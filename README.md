# Coming-Home

This is the model of a house in Inform 7 with a simples puzzle to enter.

The goal is to use it to create a game.

This model was created many years before What Remains of Edith Finch was launched, 
  but now the theme have been wonderfully used by that game.
  You can know more about the game at http://edithfinch.com/
